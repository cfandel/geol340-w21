Carleton College 
GEOL240: Hydrogeology 
Winter 2021

These exercises are based on the groundwater modeling courses developed at the University of Arizona by [Ty Ferré](https://has.arizona.edu/people/pa-ty-ferr%C3%A9), [Jesse Dickinson](https://www.usgs.gov/staff-profiles/jesse-dickinson), [Laura Condon](https://github.com/lecondon), and myself.

Each numbered folder contains a Jupyter Notebook stepping through the setup, run, and post-processing of a simple MODFLOW groundwater model, as well as all the necessary input and output files. An instructor-facing version and a student-facing version are included for each. The models increase in complexity by adding more MODFLOW packages. <br>
For shortcuts to each notebook, in order of increasing complexity, start here:

The folder titled "ocotillo" contains the materials for the final project: a more complex model that students must calibrate and use to forecast the impacts of proposed new groundwater pumping in a small agricultural valley. The student-facing notebook for this project can be found here:
